Bachelor's Thesis Project: “Music Harmony Improvisation Tool – Mobile Application”
Like many fields within education, musical learning has become ever more digitally accessible over the past 10 years. One aspect when teaching music with technology which is often overlooked is musical improvisation on an instrument. To learn this, a student needs to know which scales can be played with which chords. This project aims to create a mobile application in React Native, which takes a user’s input of a chord and returns all possible scales that can be played over their choice.

The way that this can be carried out, is by creating a dataset of all possible scales, and using a combination of sorting and searching algorithms within that
dataset to return relevant information to the user. These algorithms include brute-forcing, binary search, database indexing, and hashing algorithms. When these are applied, the correct scales can be most efficiently returned to the user.

The results of such a mobile application could be that more musical students become familiar in the field of improvisation, through the combination of traditional music theory and technology, while also creating an efficient array subset searching algorithm which could be applied to any possible dataset.
